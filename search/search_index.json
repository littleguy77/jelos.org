While saves are often compatible across different versions of RetroArch cores, states tend to break more frequently. This means that if you create states with two incompatible versions of an emulator and they are synchronized, you may lose one of them.</p> <ul> <li>For maximum compatibility, make sure to use the same cores on all devices and update them at similar frequencies.</li> <li>RetroArch uses two separate folders for saves and states. This makes it easy to choose whether you want to synchronize only saves, states, or both.</li> <li>In the RetroArch settings under \"Saving\", you can tell RetroArch to sort saves and states into subfolders based on content directory or core name.
